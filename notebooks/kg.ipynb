Many of the Company’s competitors\\nseek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and\\ninfringing on its intellectual property.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 2\\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new\\nproducts, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its\\nproducts, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive\\nfactors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and\\nperformance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem,\\nmarketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and\\naccessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant\\ntechnical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large\\ncustomer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger\\ninstalled base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered\\nproduct margins.

The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the\\nCompany’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more\\ncompetitive than those they currently offer.\\nSupply of Components\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components\\nare currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in\\nthe markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the\\nCompany, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant\\ncommodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the\\nCompany often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies,\\ninitial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The\\ncontinued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the\\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the\\nCompany will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\\nResearch and Development\\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to\\ncompete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and\\ntechnologies to the marketplace.

This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property\\nrights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is\\nan important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies\\nprimarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research,\\ndevelopment, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company\\nhas accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual\\nproperty right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its\\nintellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include\\nintellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of\\nthe Company’s products, processes and services.

As of September 28, 2024, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees.\\nCompensation and Benefits\\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the\\nCompany’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs\\nand the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives.

When any one or more of these risks materialize\\nfrom time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and\\nadversely affected.\\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, past\\nfinancial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use\\nhistorical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\nResults of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements\\nand Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse\\neconomic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In\\naddition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including\\nmanufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend\\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.\\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest', 'manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend\\nsignificantly on global and regional economic conditions.\\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest\\nrates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand\\nfor the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in\\nresponse to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic\\nfactors.\\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or\\nregional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers,\\ndistributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability;\\ninability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure\\nof derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity;\\nand declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the\\nCompany’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 5\\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions,\\nconflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\\nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers,\\nemployees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and', 'employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and\\nthe Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing\\nis performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and\\nVietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data,\\ncan materially adversely affect the Company’s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these\\nrestrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has\\nsignificant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and\\nraw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring\\nbusiness relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, services and third-party applications to\\nits customers. Changing the Company’s business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international\\ntrade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little\\nor no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts\\nfrom such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and\\nother restrictions affecting the Company’s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in\\nresponse could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business.\\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract\\nmanufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters.

For example, global supply chains can be\\nhighly concentrated and geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions.\\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays\\nand inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service\\nofferings, increase the Company’s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.\\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the\\nCompany’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and\\ncould result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major\\npublic health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future\\nmaterially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the\\nimposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and\\nthe movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution\\nchannels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps\\nof new products and development of new services.\\nFollowing any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to\\nresume operations, and lose significant sales.

The Company has also outsourced much of its\\ntransportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s\\ndirect control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse\\neffect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to\\nrespond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense\\nreimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of\\nproduct defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners\\nto adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially\\nadversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many\\ncomponents, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware\\nproducts. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or\\nfinished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety\\nof reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, economic,\\nbusiness, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, or\\nconflict.\\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and\\nhas made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements.

While these arrangements help\\nensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial\\nproblems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be disrupted or terminated, and the recoverability of\\nmanufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\\nChanges or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and\\nuncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.\\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially\\nreasonable terms.\\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant\\nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-\\nwide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of\\noperations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and\\nshortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on\\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into\\nagreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these\\nagreements on similar terms, or at all.

For the vast majority of applications,\\ndevelopers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from\\nsales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made\\nchanges to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and\\nregulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has\\nimplemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS\\nApp Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App\\nStore and Safari® in the European Union (“EU”) as it seeks to comply with the Digital Markets Act (the “DMA”), including new\\nbusiness terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps,\\nalternative payment processing for apps across the Company’s operating systems, and additional tools and application programming\\ninterfaces (“APIs”) for developers.

Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided\\non its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these\\npublic statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or\\nproceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include\\nongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company\\nis also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial\\ndata and biometric data.

For example, the\\ngross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins\\nare subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing\\npressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the\\nCompany’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply\\nshortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering\\ncontent for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix\\nof products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the\\nCompany to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic\\npressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and\\nother factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part\\nto seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and\\noperating expenses.

Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and\\noperating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in\\ndemand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected\\ndevelopments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service\\nintroductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, supply or\\nmanufacturing partners.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 15\\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to\\nlocal currencies.\\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of\\nsales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that\\ninclude components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially\\nadversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign\\ncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing\\ndemand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise\\ninternational pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins\\nthe Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign\\ncurrency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign\\ncurrency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the\\nCompany’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to', 'currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the\\nCompany’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion,\\nof the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and\\neconomic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the\\nCompany’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not realized\\nsignificant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant\\nlosses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments\\nrelated to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers\\nand resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise\\nand government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral,\\nthird-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables\\ncan be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its\\ntrade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also', 'can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its\\ntrade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also\\nhas unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors\\nthat manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments\\nassociated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 28, 2024, the Company’s\\nvendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual\\nvendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and\\nvendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its\\ncredit risk and avoid losses.\\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to\\nadditional tax liabilities.\\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of\\nthe Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and\\nother non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic\\nCo-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of\\nglobal minimum tax standards. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with\\ndiffering statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes\\nin tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to\\ndiffering interpretations.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 16\\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and\\nother tax authorities and governmental bodies.

If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is\\nfor an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could\\nbe materially adversely affected.\\nGeneral Risks\\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the\\nCompany, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and\\nvolume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating\\nperformance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed\\nthe stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and\\nprofitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current\\nlevels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration\\nby the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any\\nspecific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share\\nrepurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material\\nadverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\\nItem 1B.

Note 1, “Summary of Significant\\nAccounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant\\naccounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its\\nestimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the\\nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain\\ntax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax\\nlaws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the\\nCompany’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different\\nfrom that reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the\\nclosing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have\\na material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\\nLegal and Other Contingencies\\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which\\nare inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is\\nreasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to\\nmanage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and\\nterm debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the\\ninterest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments,\\noffset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any\\nassociated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 28, 2024 and\\nSeptember 30, 2023 (dollars in millions):\\nInterest Rate Hypothetical Interest\\nSensitive Instrument Rate Increase Potential Impact 2024 2023\\nInvestment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair value $ 2,755 $ 3,089\\nTerm debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in annual interest expense $ 139 $ 194\\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other\\nthan the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the\\nCompany’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values\\nof certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative\\ninstruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to', 'of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative\\ninstruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to\\nnot hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of\\nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value,\\nfor a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on\\nthe results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $538 million and\\n$669 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying foreign\\ncurrency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign\\ncurrency derivatives.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 27', '--- TABLE 30-1 ---\\nTerm debt\\t\\t100 basis points, all tenors\\t\\tIncrease in annual interest expense\\t\\t$\\t139\\t\\t$\\t194\\n--- END TABLE 30-1 ---\\n\\nItem 8.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the\\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s\\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time\\nas services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control\\nor commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\\nincentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When\\navailable, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established\\nthat reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold\\nregularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors\\nthat may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where\\napplicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific\\nbusiness objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and', 'applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific\\nbusiness objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and\\niPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware\\nand bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive certain\\nproduct-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts\\nto all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for product-related\\nbundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered\\nhardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the\\nproduct is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over\\nthe estimated period they are expected to be provided.\\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For\\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any\\nunbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized\\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the\\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains\\ninventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold\\nthrough the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the', 'inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold\\nthrough the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the\\nCompany accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the\\ncommission it retains.\\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions):\\n2024 2023 2022\\niPhone $ 201,183 $ 200,583 $ 205,489\\nMac 29,984 29,357 40,177\\niPad 26,694 28,300 29,292\\nWearables, Home and Accessories 37,005 39,845 41,241\\nServices (1) 96,169 85,200 78,129\\nTotal net sales $ 391,035 $ 383,285 $ 394,328\\n(1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\\nTotal net sales include $7.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023,\\n$8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, and $7.5 billion of\\nrevenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021.\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 35', '--- TABLE 38-1 ---\\nMac\\t29,984\\t\\t\\t29,357\\t\\t\\t40,177\\t\\niPad\\t26,694\\t\\t\\t28,300\\t\\t\\t29,292\\t\\nWearables, Home and Accessories\\t37,005\\t\\t\\t39,845\\t\\t\\t41,241\\t\\nServices (1)\\t96,169\\t\\t\\t85,200\\t\\t\\t78,129\\t\\nTotal net sales\\t$\\t391,035\\t\\t$\\t383,285\\t\\t$\\t394,328\\n--- END TABLE 38-1 ---', 'The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in\\nNote 13, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2024, 2023 and 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue\\nrepresented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\\nAs of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.8 billion and $12.1 billion,\\nrespectively.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to\\nthe maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of\\nthe company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial', 'the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of\\nthe company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\\nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable\\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that\\ncould have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections\\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes\\nin conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nNovember 1, 2024\\nApple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 50\\nItem 9.

The Company’s', 'to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s\\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\\ndispositions of the Company’s assets;\\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in\\naccordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\\ndisposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s\\ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can\\nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control\\nsystem must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance\\nthat all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in\\nfuture periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions,\\nor that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as\\ndefined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act).

    "\n",
    "MANDATORY RULES FOR TRIPLE EXTRACTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. RELEVANCE:\n",
    "   - Only extract triples that are directly relevant to understanding the company's:\n",
    "     * Business operations and strategy\n",
    "     * Financial performance and position\n",
    "     * Risk factors and challenges\n",
    "     * Corporate governance\n",
    "     * Key relationships (customers, suppliers, partners)\n",
    "     * Regulatory compliance\n",
    "     * Market position\n",
    "     * Competitive advantages\n",
    "     * Technology and innovation\n",
    "     * Market trends and industry position\n",
    "\n",
    "2. QUALITY CRITERIA:\n",
    "   - Subjects must be specific named entities (e.g., 'apple inc.', not 'the company')\n",
    "   - Predicates must be clear, active relationships (1-2 words maximum)\n",
    "   - Objects must be specific, quantifiable, or measurable when possible\n",
    "   - All values must be lowercase for consistency\n",
    "   - Include specific dates, amounts, and percentages when available\n",
    "   - Use standardized relationship terms for similar concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "3. AVOID:\n",
    "   - Generic or obvious statements that don't add analytical value\n",
    "   - Redundant or duplicate information\n",
    "   - Overly complex or compound relationships\n",
    "   - Ambiguous or vague entities\n",
    "   - Legal boilerplate text that doesn't convey meaningful information\n",
    "   - Forward-looking statements without specific metrics\n",
    "   - General industry information not specific to the company\n",
    "\n",
    "4. PRIORITIZE:\n",
    "   - Material financial metrics and KPIs\n",
    "   - Specific risk factors with quantifiable impact\n",
    "   - Strategic partnerships and major customer relationships\n",
    "   - Market share and competitive position data\n",
    "   - Regulatory compliance status and requirements\n",
    "   - Corporate governance structure and changes\n",
    "   - Technology investments and intellectual property\n",
    "   - Supply chain relationships and dependencies\n",
    "   - Geographic market presence and expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ENTITY TYPE GUIDELINES:\n",
    "   - Identify the most specific and relevant type for each entity\n",
    "   - Types should reflect the entity's role in the financial context\n",
    "   - Create meaningful types based on the entity's nature and usage\n",
    "   - Examples of common types (but not limited to):\n",
    "     * Business entities (companies, subsidiaries, partners)\n",
    "     * Financial instruments (stocks, bonds, derivatives)\n",
    "     * Regulatory concepts (compliance statuses, requirements)\n",
    "     * Business metrics (KPIs, financial measures)\n",
    "     * Market elements (sectors, industries, regions)\n",
    "     * Time-based elements (periods, dates, fiscal years)\n",
    "\n",
    "6 RELATIONSHIP DISCOVERY:\n",
    "   - Use natural, meaningful relationships that accurately describe the connection\n",
    "   - Relationships should be:\n",
    "     * Clear and concise (1-2 words)\n",
    "     * Action-oriented\n",
    "     * Specific to the financial domain\n",
    "     * Reflective of the true nature of the connection\n",
    "   - Avoid generic relationships like \"is\" or \"has\" when more specific ones are applicable\n",
    "\n",
    "7 CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING:\n",
    "   - Consider the broader context of the 10-K section\n",
    "   - Maintain consistency within related triples\n",
    "   - Capture relationships that provide meaningful insights\n",
