BUSINESS\nOverview\nAs our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders' letter, \"Google is not a conventional company. We\ndo not intend to become one.\" That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history, inspiring us to\ntackle big problems and invest in moonshots. It led us to be a pioneer in the development of AI and, since 2016, an AI-\nfirst company. We continue this work under the leadership of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.\nAlphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud, and all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Supporting these\nbusinesses, we have centralized certain AI-related research and development which is reported in Alphabet-level\nactivities. Alphabet's structure is about helping each of our businesses prosper through strong leaders and\nindependence.\nAccess and Technology for Everyone\nThe Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers; it propels ideas, people, and businesses large and\nsmall.

Since then, we have evolved from a company that helps people find answers\nto a company that also helps people get things done.\nWe are focused on building an even more helpful Google for everyone, and we aspire to give everyone the tools\nthey need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success. Google Search helps people find information\nand make sense of the world in more natural and intuitive ways, with trillions of searches on Google every year.\nYouTube provides people with entertainment, information, and opportunities to learn something new and helps support\nthe creator economy through the YouTube Partner Program. Google Cloud helps customers solve today’s business\nchallenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. We are continually innovating and\nbuilding new products and features to help our users, partners, customers, and communities and have invested more\nthan $150 billion in research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts.\n4.",

At Google, we have been bringing AI into our products and services for\nmore than a decade and making them available to our users.\nIn 2023, we took a significant step on our journey to make AI more helpful for everyone with the introduction of\nGemini, our natively multimodal AI model. In 2024, we launched Gemini 2.0, our most capable model yet. Gemini can\ngeneralize and seamlessly understand, operate across, and combine different types of information including text, code,\naudio, image, and video. Gemini is powering AI features across our products and services that are helping people\neveryday. Today, all seven of our two billion-user products — Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Play Store, Search, and\nYouTube — are using Gemini.\nOur Google Cloud products, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, help organizations stay at\nthe forefront of innovation with our AI-optimized infrastructure, AI development platform, world-class models, as well as\nassistive agents and applications.\nWe believe AI has the potential to solve important societal, scientific, and engineering challenges.

Principal currencies\nhedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro, and Japanese yen. For the purpose of\nanalyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and\ndetermined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10% could be experienced.\nWe use foreign currency forward and option contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on monetary assets and\nliabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August\n2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (\"Alphabet\") became\nthe successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising; cloud-based solutions that provide\nenterprise customers of all sizes with infrastructure, platform services, and applications; sales of other products and\nservices, such as fees received for subscription-based products, apps and in-app purchases, and devices.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our\nestimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair values of financial",

We base\nour estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results\nof which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the\ncollectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar\ntaxes are excluded from revenues.\nAdvertising Revenues\nWe generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\n• Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners\nwho use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated\nproperties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n• YouTube properties; and\n• Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nOur customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google Display",

We recognize revenues for\nperformance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues\nwhen the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\nFor ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a\ngross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on\nGoogle Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues,\nand amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we\ncontrol the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to\nmonetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being\nprimarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\nGoogle Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from:\n57.",
