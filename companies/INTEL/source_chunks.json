As we look ahead to the\nnext decade, we expect to see continued demand for processing power. Semiconductors are the underlying technology powering this\ndigital expansion, and we are strategically positioning ourselves to create a resilient global semiconductor supply chain by investing in\ngeographically balanced manufacturing capacity. The demand for compute is being accelerated by five superpowers: ubiquitous\ncompute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing. Together, these superpowers combine to amplify and\nreinforce each other, and increase the world's need for computing by packing even more processing capability onto ever-smaller\nmicrochips.

AI demands an ever-increasing amount of computation\nperformance and an ever-increasing need for power efficiency. To deliver the step function changes in performant yet efficient and cost-\neffective systems required to enable AI, a generational shift in computer architectures is underway, built on smaller, more efficient and\nperformant transistors.

The global semiconductor industry and our customers are changing the way they build chips and systems while\nsimultaneously redesigning their supply chains to be more resilient and sustainable.\nOver time, the capital intensity of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing has grown meaningfully and forced most manufacturers to\ngive up the pursuit of Moore’s Law as they lacked sufficient scale to drive a positive return on investments in the next-generation\nprocess technology. Currently, we believe we are only one of three manufacturers pursuing 2nm lithography. Leading-edge foundries\nseek to amortize their leading-edge investments over many years. In early years, they seek to maximize volume and pricing on leading-\nedge designs that benefit from the most performant transistors. In later years, when the once advanced process technology becomes a\nmature technology, ease of design and manufacturing cost become more paramount.\nOur strategy builds on our history of developing leading-edge semiconductor technologies for our products.

The primary objective of our\ninvestment policy is to preserve principal and provide financial flexibility to fund our business while maximizing yields, which generally\ntrack SOFR. We generally enter into interest rate contracts to convert the returns on our fixed-rate debt investment with remaining\nmaturities longer than six months into SOFR-based returns.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements include the\naccounts of Intel and our wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, which include entities consolidated under the variable interest\nand voting interest models. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions.\nWe made certain reclassifications within our Consolidated Financial Statements during 2024, and, in certain cases, adjusted prior\nperiods to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net income (loss),\ncash flows, or stockholders' equity.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that\naffect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we\nexperience may differ materially from our estimates.\nEffective January 2023, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from 5 to 8 years.

When\ncompared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, we estimated this change increased gross margin in 2023 by\napproximately $2.5 billion and decreased R&D expense by approximately $400 million. As of December 30, 2023, we estimated this\nchange decreased ending inventory values by approximately $1.3 billion. These estimates were based on the assets in use and under\nconstruction as of the beginning of 2023 and were calculated at that point in time.\nNote 2 : Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of our products or\nservices to customers. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from product sales. Our products often include a software component,\nsuch as firmware, that is highly interdependent and interrelated with the product and is substantially accounted for as a combined\nperformance obligation. In accordance with contract terms, the revenue for combined performance obligations and standalone product\nsales is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facilities or delivery to the customer location, as determined by the agreed-\nupon shipping terms.\nWe measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products or services.

Variable\nconsideration is estimated and reflected as an adjustment to the transaction price. We determine variable consideration, which consists\nprimarily of various sales price concessions, by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the\ncustomer based on historical analysis of customer purchase volumes. Sales rebates earned by customers are offset against their\nreceivable balances. Rebates earned by customers when they do not have outstanding receivable balances are recorded within other\naccrued liabilities.\nWe make payments to our customers through cooperative advertising programs for marketing activities for some of our products. We\ngenerally record the payment as a reduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned, unless the payment is for a distinct\nservice, which we record as an expense when the marketing activities occur.\nLong-Lived Assets\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nWe compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets.

As we make manufacturing process\nconversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the\nremaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we\ndetermine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to\nreflect the assets' revised useful lives. Effective January 2023, the estimated useful lives of certain machinery and equipment in our\nwafer fabrication facilities were increased from 5 to 8 years. This change in estimate was applied prospectively beginning in the first\nquarter of 2023.\nFinancial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 62",

Factors that we consider in deciding\nwhen to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations,\nsignificant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If\nthe carrying value of an asset grouping is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered\nto be impaired.\nIdentified Intangible Assets\nWe amortize acquisition-related intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful lives. We perform periodic\nreviews of significant finite-lived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount may not be recoverable. These reviews can be affected by various factors, including external factors such as industry and\neconomic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines. Periodically,\nwe also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances\nwarrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization.

We reevaluate our identified reporting units annually or when\ntriggered, such as upon reorganization of our operating segments. We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the\nreporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. The reporting unit's\ncarrying value used in an impairment assessment represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain\ncorporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. The impairment assessment may include both qualitative and\nquantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment.\nQualitative factors used include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors\naffecting the reporting unit.

We test the reasonableness of the\ninputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. These estimates change from year to year\nbased on operating results, market conditions, and other factors and could materially affect the determination of the fair value and\npotential goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Our quantitative assessment is sensitive to changes in underlying estimates and\nassumptions, the most sensitive of which is the discount rate.\nInventories\nWe compute inventory cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive\nengineering milestones. These engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our\nactivities and associated costs change in nature from R&D to cost of sales, and when cost of sales can be capitalized as inventory.\nFor a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty, it must meet our rigorous",

We have identified the start of manufacturing volume for sale to customers as the point at which the\ncosts incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory. Prior to the start of manufacturing volume for sale\nto customers, costs that do not meet the criteria for R&D are included in cost of sales in the period incurred.\nThe valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead costs can be included in inventory based on the normal\ncapacity of our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities. We apply our historical loading compared to our total available capacity\nto determine our expectations of normal capacity level. If the factory loading is below the established normal capacity level, a portion of\nour fixed production overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory; instead, it would be recognized as cost of sales in\nthat period. We refer to these costs as excess capacity charges. Excess capacity charges were $174 million in 2024, $834 million in\n2023, and $423 million in 2022.\nInventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.",

Lower of cost or net\nrealizable value inventory reserves fluctuate as we ramp new process technologies, with costs generally improving over time due to\nscale and improved yields. Additionally, inventory valuation is impacted by cyclical changes in market conditions and the associated\npricing environment.\nThe valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality.\nWe use a demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build\ndecisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecasts.

We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help confirm that the fair value measurements\nare reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset and liability classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding\nmarket consensus prices, non-binding broker quotes, and probability-weighted outcomes that we are unable to corroborate with\nobservable market data.\nEquity Investments\nWe regularly invest in equity securities of public and private companies to promote business and strategic objectives. Equity\ninvestments are measured and recorded as follows:\n▪ Marketable equity investments are equity securities with RDFV that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring\nbasis with changes in fair value, whether realized or unrealized, recorded through the income statement.\n▪ Non-marketable equity investments are equity securities without RDFV that are measured and recorded using a measurement",

Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus our share of\nequity method investee income or loss.\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value or the sale of our equity investments are recorded in\ngains (losses) on equity investments, net.

We generally place investments with\nhigh-credit-quality counterparties and, by policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of\nthat counterparty's relative credit standing. As required per our investment policy, substantially all of our investments in debt instruments\nare in investment-grade instruments. Credit-rating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions\nwith the same counterparty. Due to master netting arrangements, the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are\ngenerally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparty's obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty.

Cash\ncollateral exchanged under our collateral security arrangements is included in other current assets, other long-term assets, other\naccrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities. For reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by other securities, we do not record\nthe collateral as an asset or a liability unless the collateral is repledged.\nA substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to OEMs and ODMs. We also have accounts receivable derived\nfrom sales to industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries.

In general, the EC found\nthat we violated Article 82 by offering alleged “conditional rebates and payments” that required customers to purchase all or most of their\nx86 microprocessors from us and by making alleged “payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.” The EC ordered us to end\nthe alleged infringement referred to in its decision and imposed a €1.1 billion fine, which we paid in the third quarter of 2009.\nWe appealed the EC decision to the European Court of Justice in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance)\nrejected our appeal of the EC decision in its entirety. In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to\nexamine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. In January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC's\n2009 findings against us regarding rebates, as well as the €1.1 billion fine imposed on Intel, which was returned to us in February 2022.\nThe General Court's January 2022 decision did not annul the EC's 2009 finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival\nproducts.\nIn April 2022, the EC appealed the General Court's findings regarding rebates to the Court of Justice.

In October 2024, the Court of\nJustice dismissed the EC's appeal, upholding the judgment of the General Court.\nIn September 2023, the EC imposed a €376 million ($401 million) fine against us based on its 2009 finding that we made payments to\nprevent sales of specific rival products. We have appealed the EC's decision. We have accrued a charge for the fine and are unable to\nmake a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses in excess of this amount given the procedural posture and the\nnature of these proceedings.\nIn a related matter, in April 2022, we filed applications with the General Court seeking an order requiring the EC to pay us approximately\n€593 million ($647 million) in default interest on the original €1.1 billion ($1.2 billion) fine that was held by the EC for 12 years.
