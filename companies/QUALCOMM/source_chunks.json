Relevant cellular wireless technologies can be grouped into the following categories.\nCDMA-based. CDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the same\nfrequency and time by allocating different orthogonal codes to individual users. Most of the CDMA-based technologies are classified\nas 3G technology. CDMA-based connections worldwide continue to decline as consumers migrate to OFDMA-based technologies,\nwhich comprise the majority of cellular connections today.\nOFDMA-based.

Many of our products and much of our intellectual property are incorporated into consumer wireless devices, which\nare subject to seasonality and other fluctuations in demand. Our revenues have historically fluctuated based on consumer demand for\ndevices, as well as on the timing of customer/licensee device launches and/or innovation cycles (such as the transition to the next\ngeneration of wireless technologies). This has resulted in fluctuations in QCT revenues in advance of and during device launches\nincorporating our products and in QTL revenues when licensees’ sales occur. These trends may or may not continue in the future.\nFurther, the trends for QTL have been, and may in the future be, impacted by disputes and/or resolutions with licensees and/or\ngovernmental investigations or proceedings.\n40\nFiscal 2024 Overview\nRevenues were $39.0 billion, an increase of 9% compared to revenues of $35.8 billion in fiscal 2023, with net income of $10.1",

Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements",

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants as of the measurement date. Applicable accounting guidance provides an established hierarchy for inputs used in\nmeasuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the\nmost observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in valuing the asset or\nliability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect\nour assumptions about the factors that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. There are three levels of inputs\nthat may be used to measure fair value:\n• Level 1 includes financial instruments for which quoted market prices for identical instruments are available in active\nmarkets.\n• Level 2 includes financial instruments for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are\nobservable for the instrument.\n• Level 3 includes financial instruments for which fair value is derived from valuation techniques in which one or more\nsignificant inputs are unobservable, including our own assumptions.",

We recognize transfers into and out of\nlevels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the fiscal month in which the actual event or change in circumstances that caused\nthe transfer to occur.\nCash Equivalents and Marketable Securities: We obtain pricing information from quoted market prices, pricing vendors or quotes\nfrom brokers/dealers.

The fair value of mortgage- and asset-backed securities is derived from the use of matrix pricing\n(prices for similar securities) or, in some cases, cash flow pricing models with observable inputs, such as contractual terms, maturity,\ncredit rating and/or securitization structure to determine the timing and amount of future cash flows.\nDerivative Instruments: Derivative instruments that are traded on an exchange are valued using quoted market prices and are\nincluded in Level 1.

Valuation techniques consistent with the market\napproach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to measure fair value.
