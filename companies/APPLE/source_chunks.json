The Company will adopt\nASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method.\nSegment Reporting\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures (“ASU 2023-07”), which will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly\nprovided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”).

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to\nmanage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and\nterm debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the\ninterest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments,\noffset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any\nassociated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 28, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023 (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate Hypothetical Interest\nSensitive Instrument Rate Increase Potential Impact 2024 2023\nInvestment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair value $ 2,755 $ 3,089\nTerm debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in annual interest expense $ 139 $ 194\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk",

Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the\nCompany’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values\nof certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative\ninstruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to\nnot hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of\nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value,\nfor a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on",
