Since our original focus on PC\ngraphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand\nfor exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for\nscientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and digital twin applications.\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April\n1998.\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\nDemand and Supply",

Demand for our Hopper architecture drove our significant growth for the full year. We began shipping production systems\nof the Blackwell architecture in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels.\nWe may not be able to generate significant revenue from them. Advancements in accelerated computing and generative AI models,\nalong with the growth in model complexity and scale, have driven increased demand for our Data Center systems.\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections and\nincreasing complexity of our data center products. With these additions, we have also entered and may continue to enter into\nprepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products.

The increased purchase volumes and\nintegration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain creates more complexity in managing multiple\nsuppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component\ncompatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or\nimpairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\nProduct Transitions and New Product Introductions\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners\nprepare to ship and support new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center,\nGaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive products. The computing industry is experiencing a broader and faster launch\ncadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. We have introduced a new\nproduct and architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions each year and\nprovide a greater variety of Data Center offerings.

The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products\nand product configurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create\nvolatility in our revenue. The increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production\nissues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. We incur significant engineering\ndevelopment resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability to develop other products or\nadequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new\nproducts or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply\nchain cost. While we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these\ntransitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional\ncosts.\nGlobal Trade\nIn August 2022, the USG announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong",

We will continue to\nevaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated,\ncan provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a\ncontrol system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to\ntheir costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that\nall control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.\n46\nTable of Contents",

Also, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes\nin conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n50\nTable of Contents\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or",

All share, equity award, and per share amounts and\nrelated shareholders' equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January.

Actual results could differ materially from\nour estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to accounts receivable, cash equivalents\nand marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and product purchase commitments, investigation and settlement\ncosts, litigation, non-marketable equity securities, other contingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other\ncharges, revenue recognition, and stock-based compensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software\nlicensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a\ncustomer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of\nthe transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price",

Payment from customers, per our standard payment terms,\nis generally due shortly after delivery of products, availability of software licenses or commencement of services.\nProduct Sales Revenue\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the\nconsideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty\nfor the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the\nservice period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes\ncollected from customers.\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated\nproduct returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.

We account for customer programs as a reduction\nto revenue and accrue for such programs for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by\ncustomers.\n57\nTable of Contents\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Continued)\nLicense and Development Arrangements\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components.

Customers\nmay purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer\nbenefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with support, which includes the right to receive, on a when-\nand-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades.

For\nderivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable\nsecurities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the\ndiversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio maturities. We perform ongoing\ncredit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists\nof an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure\nexcludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\nInventories\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis.\nInventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging,\nmanufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping",

We charge cost of sales for inventory\nprovisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess\nproduct purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory\nlevels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once\ninventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We\nrecord a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts\nconsistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed\nusing the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets of two to seven years.

In completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit\nbasis.\nQualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors\naffecting the reporting units.\nThe quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair\nvalue. The income and market valuation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial\ninformation, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry\nand require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our\nbusiness.\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets",
