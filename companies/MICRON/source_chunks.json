For our\nlocations in Singapore and Taiwan, this is also a combination of bringing fabrication and back-end manufacturing\ntogether. We make significant investments to develop proprietary product and process technology, which generally\nincreases bit density per wafer and reduces per-bit manufacturing costs of each generation of product. We continue to\nintroduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, including higher data transfer\nrates, advanced packaging solutions, lower power consumption, improved read/write reliability, and increased memory\ndensity.\nWe face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets. To remain competitive we must\ncontinuously develop and implement new products and technologies and decrease manufacturing costs in spite of\ninflationary pressures.

Business – Overview.”\nIndustry Conditions\nThroughout 2024, we experienced substantial improvements in pricing and margins. Increasing demand growth, driven\nin part by deployment of AI and mostly normal customer inventories, combined with industry-wide supply discipline,\nresulted in an industry supply and demand balance that substantially improved from 2023 conditions. We executed well\non pricing and improved our financial performance significantly from the start of the year. We are exiting the year with\nexcellent momentum and an industry-leading product portfolio.\nIn contrast, 2023 was a year of weak memory and storage industry demand in many end markets, stemming from\nglobal macroeconomic challenges and customer actions to reduce inventory levels. These conditions, which began in\nthe fourth quarter of 2022 and persisted into early 2024, led to significant reductions in average selling prices for both",
  "149": "global macroeconomic challenges and customer actions to reduce inventory levels. These conditions, which began in\nthe fourth quarter of 2022 and persisted into early 2024, led to significant reductions in average selling prices for both\nDRAM and NAND and reductions in bit shipments for DRAM. We experienced declines in revenue across all our\nbusiness segments and nearly all our end markets throughout 2023. Also in 2023, China’s Cyberspace Administration\n(the “CAC”) conducted a cybersecurity review of our products sold in China and decided that our products presented a\ncybersecurity risk. The CAC determined that critical information infrastructure operators in China may not purchase\nMicron products. The CAC decision has impacted our business, particularly in the domestic data center and networking\nmarkets in China, and we have been working to mitigate that impact. Our goal is to retain our worldwide DRAM and\nNAND market share.\nIn manufacturing, we have been fully utilized throughout most of 2024 on our high-volume manufacturing nodes where\nwe are maximizing output against our current capacity, which we have proactively, structurally lowered. Beginning in the\nlatter part of 2022, we reduced capital expenditures and wafer starts for both DRAM and NAND in response to\nchallenging market conditions and increased levels of our inventories. In addition, to improve capital efficiency, we\nredeployed equipment from older technology nodes to support conversions to leading-edge nodes. Since the number of",

In addition, to improve capital efficiency, we\nredeployed equipment from older technology nodes to support conversions to leading-edge nodes. Since the number of\nwafer processing steps is higher for leading-edge nodes, this approach has resulted in a meaningful structural\nreduction in DRAM and NAND wafer capacity. We believe this approach to node migration and consequent wafer\ncapacity reduction was adopted across the industry. We recognized period costs from fabrication facility underutilization\nof $382 million in 2023 and $165 million in the first quarter of 2024 due to wafer start reductions. Subsequently,\nfabrication facility underutilization was reduced and principally related to legacy manufacturing capacity. Accordingly,\n2024 period costs beyond the first quarter were not significant.\nIn connection with improved 2024 market conditions, we reinstated our bonuses and phased out certain other\ntemporary cost-saving measures that were implemented in 2023. We took significant steps in 2023 to reduce our costs\nand operating expenses, both on a temporary and ongoing structural basis. These measures included the 2023\nRestructure Plan, as well as implementing productivity programs, suspension of our 2023 bonus, reductions in select\nproduct programs, lower discretionary spending, and cuts to 2023 executive salaries.

Cost includes depreciation, labor, material, and overhead costs, including product and process\ntechnology costs. Determining net realizable value of finished goods and work in process inventories involves\nsignificant judgments, including projecting future average selling prices, future sales volumes, and future cost per\npart. To project average selling prices and sales volumes, we review recent sales volumes, existing customer orders,\ncurrent contract prices, industry analyses of supply and demand, and general economic trends. To project cost per part,\nwe review trends with historical results and consider known changes in our cost structure as applicable.

For derivative\ninstruments designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments and the offsetting\nchanges in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are both recognized in earnings. For foreign currency and\ncommodity derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges, time value is excluded from the\nassessment of effectiveness and the gains and losses attributable to time value are recognized in earnings through an\namortization approach. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges\nare classified in the same category as the items being hedged.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements with our counterparties to mitigate credit risk in derivative hedge\ntransactions.

Estimates and judgments are\nbased on historical experience, forecasted events, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable\nunder the circumstances. Estimates and judgments may differ under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate\nour estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results could differ from estimates.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)\n2023-07 (ASC Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.
