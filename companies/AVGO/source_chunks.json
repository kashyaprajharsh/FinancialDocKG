We also record reductions of revenue for rebates in the same period that the related\nrevenue is recorded. We accrue 100% of potential rebates at the time of sale. We reverse the accrual of unclaimed\nrebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer\nsubject to payment and will not be paid.

Although we\nbelieve the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are\nbased, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and\nare inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets include, the present value of\nprojected cash flows regarding the projected revenues, projected expenses which include cost of revenue, research\nand development and selling, general and administrative expenses, technology obsolescence rate, contributory asset\ncharges, discount rate and income tax rate for developed technology; the projected revenues, customer retention rate,\ncustomer ramp up period, discount rate and income tax rate for the customer contracts and related relationships; the\nprojected revenues, technology obsolescence rate, expected costs to develop IPR&D into commercially viable",

We perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the\nfourth fiscal quarter of each year, and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. The process of\nevaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. To review for\nimpairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination\nthat it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Our\nqualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, whether performed annually or based on specific events or\ncircumstances, considers various macroeconomic, industry-specific and company-specific factors. These factors\ninclude: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant company-specific actions, including exiting an",

These factors\ninclude: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant company-specific actions, including exiting an\nactivity in conjunction with restructuring of operations; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of our financial\nperformance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value. After assessing the\ntotality of events and circumstances, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our\nreporting units is less than its carrying amount, no further assessment is performed. If we determine that it is more likely\nthan not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the fair value of\nthat reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit’s net book value.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our\ngoodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair\nvalue. The income approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the reporting unit estimates for\nforecasted future financial performance, including revenues, operating expenses, and taxes, as well as working capital\nand capital asset requirements. These estimates are developed as part of our long-term planning process based on",

These estimates are developed as part of our long-term planning process based on\nassumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share, estimated costs based on historical\ndata and various internal estimates. Projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount\nrate that properly accounts for the estimated market weighted-average cost of capital, as well as any risk unique to the\nsubject cash flows. The market approach is based on weighting the financial multiples of comparable companies and\napplying a control premium. A reporting unit's carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities,\nexcluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash and debt.\nWe assess the impairment of long-lived assets, including purchased IPR&D, property, plant and equipment, right-\nof-use assets, and intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of\nsuch assets may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include:\n(i) significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) significant changes in the\nmanner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, or (iii) significant negative industry or",

The process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived assets under the accounting\nguidance on property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets is also highly subjective and requires significant\njudgment. In order to estimate the fair value of long-lived assets, we typically make various assumptions about the\nfuture prospects of our business or the part of our business to which the long-lived assets relate. We also consider\nmarket factors specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business, which requires\nsignificant judgment as it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future\nyears. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to\nreduce the value of the long-lived assets stated on our consolidated balance sheets to reflect their estimated fair value.\nAssumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective.

Significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for or benefit from income\ntaxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be\nrequired against the deferred tax assets. We have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent\nand feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances. An adjustment to the valuation\nallowance will either increase or decrease our provision for or benefit from income taxes in the period such\ndetermination is made. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we accrue an income tax\nliability when such positions do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and\nregulations in a multitude of jurisdictions.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nForeign currency remeasurement. We operate in a U.S. dollar functional currency environment. Foreign currency\nassets and liabilities for monetary accounts are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates. Non-monetary\nitems such as inventory and property, plant and equipment, are measured and recorded at historical exchange rates.\nThe effects of foreign currency remeasurement were not material for any period presented.\nUse of estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets\nand liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, and such differences could affect the results\nof operations reported in future periods.\n56\nTable of Contents\nCash and cash equivalents.

We consider all highly liquid investment securities with original maturities of three\nmonths or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We determine the appropriate classification of our cash\nand cash equivalents at the time of purchase.\nTrade accounts receivable, net. Trade accounts receivable are recognized at the invoiced amount and do not bear\ninterest. Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the\nexpected credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the allowance based on historical experience\nand current economic conditions, among other factors. Allowances for doubtful accounts were not material as of\nNovember 3, 2024 or October 29, 2023. Accounts receivable are also recognized net of sales returns and distributor\ncredit allowances. These amounts are recognized when it is both probable and estimable that discounts will be granted\nor products will be returned. Allowances for sales returns and distributor credit allowances as of November 3, 2024 and\nOctober 29, 2023 were $101 million and $137 million, respectively.\nConcentrations of credit risk and significant customers.

  "217": "October 29, 2023 were $101 million and $137 million, respectively.\nConcentrations of credit risk and significant customers. Our cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable are\npotentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents may be redeemable upon demand and are\nmaintained with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality and therefore bear minimal\ncredit risk. We seek to mitigate our credit risks by spreading such risks across multiple counterparties and monitoring\nthe risk profile of these counterparties. Our accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers\nlocated both within and outside the U.S. We mitigate collection risks from our customers by performing regular credit\nevaluations of our customers’ financial conditions, and require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees,\nin certain circumstances.\nConcentration of other risks. We operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant\ntechnological changes, shifting customer needs, the emergence of competitive products with new capabilities, general\neconomic conditions worldwide, the ability to safeguard patents and other intellectual property (“IP”) in a rapidly\nevolving market and reliance on third-party wafer fabricators, assembly and test subcontractors and independent\ndistributors and other factors could affect our financial results.",
  "218": "economic conditions worldwide, the ability to safeguard patents and other intellectual property (“IP”) in a rapidly\nevolving market and reliance on third-party wafer fabricators, assembly and test subcontractors and independent\ndistributors and other factors could affect our financial results.\nInventory. We value our inventory at the lower of actual cost or net realizable value of the inventory, with cost\nbeing determined under the first-in, first-out method. We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based\nprimarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements. The excess and obsolete balance\ndetermined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess and obsolete inventory charge and the written-down\nvalue of the inventory becomes its new cost basis.\nRetirement benefit plans. For defined benefit pension plans, we consider various factors in determining our\nrespective benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost, including the number of employees that we expect to\nreceive benefits, their salary levels and years of service, the expected return on plan assets, the discount rate, the\ntiming of the payment of benefits, and other actuarial assumptions. If the actual results and events of the benefit plans\ndiffer from our current assumptions, the benefit obligations may be over- or under-valued.\nThe key assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. The U.S. discount rates",
  "219": "differ from our current assumptions, the benefit obligations may be over- or under-valued.\nThe key assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. The U.S. discount rates\nare based on a hypothetical yield curve constructed using high-quality corporate bonds selected to yield cash flows that\nmatch the expected timing and amount of the benefit payments. The U.S. expected rate of return on plan assets is set\nequal to the discount rate due to the implementation of our fully-matched, liability-driven investment strategy. We\nevaluate these assumptions at least annually. For the non-U.S. plans, we set assumptions specific to each country. We\nhave elected to measure defined benefit pension plan assets and liabilities as of October 31, which is the month end\nthat is closest to our fiscal year end.\nDerivative instruments. We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk and\ninterest rate risk. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nOutstanding derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities at their fair values based on Level 2 inputs, as\ndefined in the fair value hierarchy. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value\nare initially recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax in the period of change, and are subsequently\nreclassified and recognized in the same line item as the hedged item when either the hedged transactions affect",

These forward\ncontracts are not designated as hedging instruments, and the changes in fair value are recognized in other income\n(expense), net in the period of change. We did not have any material foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding\nas of November 3, 2024 or October 29, 2023. The gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), net for\nderivative instruments not designated as hedges were not material.\n57\nTable of Contents\nDuring fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we entered into treasury rate lock contracts that mature in approximately one\nyear to hedge variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of anticipated future debt\nissuances.

In fiscal year 2024, upon the\nissuance of our $1.75 billion 4.800% senior notes due October 2034 as discussed in Note 10. “Borrowings”, $75 million\nout of the $371 million pre-tax cumulative gain in accumulated other comprehensive income will be amortized to\ninterest expense through October 15, 2034 using the effective interest method. The remaining cumulative gain will be\namortized to interest expense associated with future debt referencing the hedged treasury rates.\nProperty, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation\nand amortization. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized, and maintenance, repairs and minor\nrenewals are expensed as incurred. Assets are held in construction in progress until placed in service, upon which date,\nwe begin to depreciate these assets.

We use the straight-line method of depreciation for all property, plant and\nequipment.\nLeases. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement and\nevaluate whether the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease at the commencement date. We recognize right-of-\nuse (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases with terms greater than 12 months, and\naccount for the lease and non-lease components as a single component. ROU assets represent our right to use an\nasset for the lease term, while lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments. Operating and finance\nlease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at\nthe lease commencement date. We use the implicit interest rate or, if not readily determinable, our incremental\nborrowing rate as of the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments.

Lease terms may include options to\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is recognized based on the effective\ninterest method over the lease term.\nFair value measurement. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level\nhierarchy is applied to prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the\nhighest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)\nand the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance on fair value measurements are described below:\nLevel 1 — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the\nreporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Our Level 1 assets include cash equivalents,",

We measure trading securities investments\nand investment funds at quoted market prices as they are traded in active markets with sufficient volume and frequency\nof transactions.\nLevel 2 — Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the\nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must\nbe observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 — Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is little, if any, market\nactivity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. Level 3 assets and liabilities include investment in equity\nsecurities without readily determinable fair values, goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, which\nare measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow approach when they are impaired.

As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition\ndate, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill.\nUpon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities\nassumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in our consolidated statements of\noperations.

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net\ntangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually\n(or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment. To review for impairment, we first assess qualitative\nfactors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair\nvalue of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of\ngoodwill, whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances, considers various macroeconomic,\nindustry-specific and company-specific factors. Those factors include: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends;\n(ii) significant company-specific actions, including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations;",

After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, if we determine that it\nis not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no further\nassessment is performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is\nless than its carrying amount, we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the\nreporting unit’s net book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its net book value, there is no\nimpairment. Otherwise, we calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and\nintangible assets, excluding goodwill, of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit. The implied fair value\nof goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill.

Purchased finite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization.\nAmortization is recognized over the periods during which the intangible assets are expected to contribute to our cash\nflows. Purchased IPR&D projects are capitalized at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and assessed for\nimpairment thereafter. Upon completion of each underlying project, IPR&D assets are reclassified as amortizable\npurchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, we\nrecognize the carrying value of the related intangible asset in our consolidated statements of operations in the period it\nis abandoned. On a quarterly basis, we monitor factors and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying\namounts of long-lived assets, including purchased intangible assets, ROU assets, and property, plant and equipment,\nmay not be recoverable.

An impairment loss must be measured if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and before\ninterest) from the use and eventual disposition of the asset (or asset group) is less than the net book value of the asset\n(or asset group). The amount of the impairment loss will generally be measured as the difference between the net book\nvalue of the asset (or asset group) and the estimated fair value.\nWarranty. We accrue for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. Product\nwarranty costs are estimated based upon our historical experience and specific identification of the product\nrequirements, which may fluctuate based on product mix. Additionally, we accrue for warranty costs associated with\noccasional or unanticipated product quality issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n59\nTable of Contents\nRevenue recognition.

The timing of revenue recognition and required payments can differ and payment terms are\ngenerally structured to provide the customer with predictable and dependable ways to procure our products, not to\nprovide or receive financing from the customer.\nNature of Products and Services\nOur products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and subscriptions and services.

We have elected to exclude from the transaction price\nany taxes collected from a customer and to account for shipping and handling activities performed after a customer\nobtains control of the product as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the product. From time to time, certain\ncustomers agree to pay us secure supply fees in exchange for prioritized fulfillment of product orders. Such fees are\nincluded in the transaction price of the product orders and are recognized as revenue in the period that control over the\nproducts is transferred to the customer.\nSubscriptions and services. Our subscriptions and services revenue consists of sales and royalties from software\narrangements, support services, professional services, transfer of IP, and non-recurring engineering (“NRE”)\narrangements.\nRevenue from software arrangements primarily consists of fees, which may be paid either at contract inception or\nin installments over the contract term, that provide customers with a right to use the software, access general support\nand maintenance, and utilize our professional services.\nOur software licenses have standalone functionality from which customers derive benefit, and the customer\nobtains control of the software when it is delivered or made available for download.

Certain of our\nsubscriptions and services arrangements permit our customers to unilaterally terminate or cancel these arrangements\nat any time at the customer’s convenience, referred to as termination for convenience provisions, without substantive\ntermination penalty and receive a pro-rata refund of any prepaid fees. Accordingly, we account for arrangements with\nthese termination for convenience provisions as a series of daily contracts, resulting in ratable revenue recognition of\nsoftware revenue over the contractual period.\nSupport services consist primarily of telephone support and the provision of unspecified updates and upgrades on\na when-and-if-available basis. Support services represent stand-ready obligations for which revenue is recognized\nratably over the term of the arrangement.\nProfessional services consist of implementation, consulting, customer education and customer training services.\nThe obligation to provide professional services is generally satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously\nreceiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our performance obligations.",

IP revenue recognition is dependent on the nature and\nterms of each agreement. We recognize IP revenue upon delivery of the IP if there are no substantive future obligations\nto perform under the arrangement. Sales-based or usage-based royalties from the license of IP are recognized at the\nlater of the period the sales or usages occur or the satisfaction of the performance obligation to which some or all of the\nsales-based or usage-based royalties have been allocated.\nThere are two main categories of NRE contracts that we enter into with our customers: (a) NRE contracts in which\nwe develop a custom chip and (b) NRE contracts in which we accelerate our development of a new chip upon the\ncustomer’s request. The majority of our NRE contract revenues meet the over time criteria. As such, revenue is\nrecognized over the development period with the measure of progress using the input method based on costs incurred\nto total cost as the services are provided.

Contracts with customers may also include material rights that are also performance obligations.\nThese include the right to renew or receive products or services at a discounted price in the future. Revenue allocated\nto material rights is recognized when the customer exercises the right or the right expires.\n60\nTable of Contents\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately\naccounted for as a distinct performance obligation.\nAllocation of consideration.

Retirement Plans\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nThe U.S. defined benefit pension plans primarily consist of a qualified pension plan. Benefits of the qualified\npension plan are provided under an adjusted career-average-pay program, a cash-balance program or a dollar-per-\nmonth program. Benefit accruals under this plan were frozen in 2009. Participants in the adjusted career-average-pay\nprogram no longer earn service accruals. Participants in the cash-balance program no longer earn service accruals, but\ncontinue to earn 4% interest per year on their cash-balance accounts. There are no active participants under the dollar-\nper-month program. We also have a frozen non-qualified supplemental pension plan in the United States that\nprincipally provides benefits based on compensation in excess of amounts that can be considered under the qualified\npension plan.\nFor certain non-U.S. countries, we also have defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees. Eligibility is\ngenerally determined based on the terms of our plans and local statutory requirements.\n73",
