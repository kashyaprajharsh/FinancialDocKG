If we do not continue to innovate and provide products, devices, and services that appeal to\nbusinesses and consumers, we may not remain competitive, which may adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nCompetition among platform-based ecosystems\nAn important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many\nparticipants can build diverse solutions.

We face significant\ncompetition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and\ntablets. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and\nits platform. Users continue to turn to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by\nPCs. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a PC, the prevalence of these devices\nmay make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing\nwith operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular\nproducts or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition,\nsome of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners,\nwhich may affect their commitment to our platform.",

In addition, we are focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing\nproducts and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity,\ncommunication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, and gaming devices.

Our data-handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under\nscrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or\nproduct experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption. Developing new technologies is complex. It\ncan require long development and testing periods.

If an arrangement fails to adequately\nanticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the\narrangement. We also have limited ability to control or influence third parties with whom we have arrangements, which\nmay impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits. The success of these transactions and arrangements depend\nin part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones,\nas well as the acquired companies’ ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance,\nprivacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and\narrangements, such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we\nexpected.

However, some\nof our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at\nthese suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.

Notice 2023-55, issued in\nthe first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024\nfor Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effective date of final\nforeign tax credit regulations indefinitely.\nOur effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in\nforeign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional\noperations center in Ireland.\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a\nresult of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below\nan operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances\nchange that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or\ncircumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance\nindicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment\nof assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value\nof each reporting unit.

  "199": "PART II\nItem 8\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nAccounting Principles\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).\nWe have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior\nperiod amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated\ncash flows statements.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated.\nEstimates and Assumptions\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue\nrecognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the\nstandalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as\nproduct returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of\ngoodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible",

Actual results and outcomes may differ from\nmanagement’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments\nin software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in\ntechnology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from\nfour years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.\nForeign Currencies\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date.\nRevenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments\nresulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.\nRevenue",

Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.\n61\nPART II\nItem 8\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that\ncan include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted\nfor as separate performance obligations.

Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected\nfrom customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nNature of Products and Services\nLicenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made\navailable to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide\ncustomers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the\nsoftware. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is\nmade available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the\nupdates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally\nratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.\nCertain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with\nSoftware Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and\nprovides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently.

Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized\nratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises\ndistinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the\nsoftware, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a\nsubscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a\nconsumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of\nsuch resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and\nthe individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud\nservices are provided.\nRevenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the\naction necessary to earn the revenue has been completed.

When a cloud-based service includes both on-\npremises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is\nconsidered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and\nrecognized over time.

We use a single amount to\nestimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates\nprovided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and\nservices separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the\nvarious products and services.\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we\ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have\nmore than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by\ncustomers and circumstances.

Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and\nupdated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated\nvariable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\nContract Balances and Other Receivables\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when\nrevenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing.

For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected\nproduct failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The\nspecific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do\nbusiness, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For\nsoftware warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the\nsoftware. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust\nthe amounts as necessary.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and\nother headcount-related expenses associated with product development.

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.7\nbillion, $904 million, and $1.5 billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units\n(“PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over\nthe related service or performance period.

The tax effect\nof such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation\nallowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified\nas long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.\nFinancial Instruments\nInvestments\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase\nto be cash equivalents.

Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other\ncomprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates\ndetermined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors,\ngeneral market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than\ncost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and\nqualitative evidence.

If market, industry, and/or investee\nconditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily\ndeterminable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable\nchanges in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on\na periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less\nthan carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.\nInvestments that are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”) are evaluated to determine whether we are the\nprimary beneficiary of the VIE, in which case we would be required to consolidate the entity.

Therefore, our VIE investments\nare not consolidated and the majority are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\nDerivatives\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for\nchanges in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income\n(expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components\nexcluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of\nother comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding\nhedged item.

The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on\nthe extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair\nvalue measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. These levels are:\n• Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our\nLevel 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds.\nOur Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.\n66\nPART II\nItem 8\n• Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for\nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g.\nthe Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated",

Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S.\nagency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and\nbonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap\ncontracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts.\n• Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions\nthat market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined\nusing model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models.

The fair values of\nthese investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include\nquoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials,\nlabor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the\nestimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory\nquantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory.

The operating lease ROU\nasset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.

For\ncertain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease\ncomponent. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the\noperating lease ROU assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating\nsegment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would\nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\nIntangible Assets",

We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account\nevents or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.\nRelated Party Transactions\nIn March 2024, we entered into an agreement with Inflection AI, Inc.
